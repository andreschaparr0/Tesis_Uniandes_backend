About You: 

You have relentlessly high standards - many people may think your standards are unreasonably high. You are continually raising the bar and driving those around you to deliver great results. You make sure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.
You’re not bound by convention - your success—and much of the fun—lies in developing new ways to do things
You need action - speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk-taking.
You earn trust - you listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully.
You have backbone; disagree, then commit - you can respectfully challenge decisions when you disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. You have conviction and are tenacious. You do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, you commit wholly.
